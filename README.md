# Credit_Risk_Modeling

*  Objective :  Developed a credit risk prediction model to assess the likelihood of loan default using historical loan data.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
* Feature Engineering: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model performance.
* Modeling Techniques: Utilized various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
* Model Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 78% on the training dataset and 80% on the test dataset, indicating good generalization capability.
* Tools and Technologies: Employed Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and model development.
* Outcome: Successfully developed a robust model for predicting credit risk, aiding in better decision-making for loan approvals.ect is to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of loan default by borrowers.
